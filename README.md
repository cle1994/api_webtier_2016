# Emporer
### Client app for a photography/design blog
##### A personal project by Christian Le `cle1994`


I started working on this project during my free time for fun. I wanted a place where people
could display their work and tell their stories without all the fuss of social pressure. Ideally,
this project should take the technical difficulties of hosting a website or personal blog away too.


This project will remain free as long as I can maintain it without it becoming a financial
burden. If I ever need to charge to offset hosting costs, I'll probably charge for custom domains 
while always maintaining a free tier. This is on the premise that I'm the only person working on
the project and it is solely a side project with minimal maintenance and no expectations from
users.
